    description:
      "\t\n\tAs a project management program for software teams, Logger allows developers to collaborate with members across the organization working on the same project. The workflow process behind Logger is the Scrum framework. Teams can create tickets according to software specifications or user stories. Teams can group tickets into Sprints: a block with a defined work period and goal. By activating a Sprint, a team commits to completing encompassed tickets by the Sprint deadline.\n\tThroughout the Sprint cycle, progress can be easily tracked in the general dashboard or Sprint-specific charts within the Charts & Metrics tab. The Ticket Log tab provides an overview of all tickets added to a project and the Board tab shows a detailed view of the project's Active Sprint broken down by ticket status.",
